                "description": "Join us as we visit the Boone County Heritage Museum in Harrison, Arkansas to check out the Dogpatch USA Theme Park exhibit.  Dogpatch USA was a theme park located in northwest Arkansas along State Highway 7 between the cities of Harrison and Jasper, an area known today as Marble Falls. It was based on the comic strip Li'l Abner, created by cartoonist Al Capp and set in a fictional village called Dogpatch. The park opened in 1968, and closed in 1993.  During the 25 years of business, the park brought in tourists from all parts of North America.  Characters like Li'l Abner, Daisy Mae, Mammy & Pappy Yokum and lots of other hillbilly named characters roamed the park picking fun with visitors.  There were unusual rides around the property as well as several shows to entertain everyone.  Even though it has been nearly 30 years since the park closed in 1993, people still talk about the park and the memories their family made there.  Once in a while, I run across someone who saw me play drums on the Riverbend Music Show there.  Our show cast members for the Riverbend Music Show were Gary Van Meter on the Steel Guitar, John Payne on Piano, Randy Hall on Lead Guitar, Mel Bartlow on Bass Guitar, Jereme Dison on drums, and vocals by Bryce Gage, Brenda Maynard, James Walls, Jackson Nightingale and Ken Bevins.  My time working with the show at Dogpatch USA will be days that I will cherish for the rest of my life.  I hope you enjoy this video.  I would love to hear your comments about your memories of the park in the comments.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you like our videos and would like to show some love and support, go to   https://tinyurl.com/SupportHFLT to make a one-time contribution or a monthly pledge.
